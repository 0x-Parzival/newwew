# Kalki OS Agent/Overlay UI

- Terminal and web UI for live agent/overlay control and intervention.
- Terminal UI: built with prompt_toolkit or rich (Python-only, works in ArchISO).
- Web UI: built with Flask/FastAPI (backend) and React/Vue (frontend, optional).
- Users can interact with, pause, or redirect agent actions in real time.
- All UI code is compatible with minimal ArchISO Python environments.
