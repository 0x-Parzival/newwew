# Kalki OS Agent/Overlay Memory

- Each agent/overlay has a persistent memory file (JSON) in this directory.
- Memory grows organically as agents learn from user interactions and tasks.
- Users can inspect or edit memory files for transparency and debugging.
- Example: 01-matsya.json, agent-zero.json, etc.
